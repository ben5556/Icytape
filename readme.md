## About

Ninja Media Script is a Viral Fun Media Sharing Site! Add unlimited images, videos, gifs, etc... Loaded with themes and functionality to make the site your own. It was built using the Laravel Voyager Admin as the back-end of the site. Be sure to checkout the demo to learn more.

You can find the product page, buy page, demo page, laravel page and voyager page links below:

- [Product Page](https://devdojo.com/scripts/php/ninja-media-script)
- [Demo Page](https://demo.devdojo.com/?product=ninja-media-script)
- [Laravel](https://laravel.com)
- [Voyager](https://laravelvoyager.com)

Next, let's learn about some of the system requirements you will need in order to install the script.

## Requirements

Ninja Media Script was built using Laravel 5.5, this means that the same system requirements needed for the script are the same as the system requirements for Laravel 5.5.

 - PHP >= 7.0.0
 - OpenSSL PHP Extension
 - PDO PHP Extension
 - Mbstring PHP Extension
 - Tokenizer PHP Extension
 - XML PHP Extension
 - GD Image Library
 - `file_get_contents` enabled
 - `file_put_contents` enabled

To learn more about the system requirements needed to run a Laravel 5.5 script checkout the following [Server Requirements](https://laravel.com/docs/5.5/installation#server-requirements)

Next, we'll get started by learning how you can download the latest version of the script.

## Getting Started

With a Premium Subscription on the DevDojo you will be able to download all the PHP scripts and self host them (optionally, as a Premium subscriber you can take advantage of our free hosting solution).

With the self-hosted version you will want to download the script by visiting the product page at [https://devdojo.com/scripts/php/ninja-media-script](https://devdojo.com/scripts/php/ninja-media-script)

<img src="https://devdojo.com/media/products/ninja-media-script/product-page.png" alt="product page" />

Click on the download button to download the latest version of the script.

Next, we'll move on to learning how to install the Ninja Media Script.

## Installation

After downloading the script you will need to unzip the `pixel.zip` file. Next you will want to copy the contents of the unzipped folder to your server.

> Before running through the installation wizard, you will need to create a MySQL database for your site. Make sure to have your database name, database user, and database password handy to continue through the installation.

After Moving all the necessary files to your server and creating a database you will want to perform the following 3 steps:

**Step 1: Install Composer Dependencies** - You will need to install the composer dependencies in your application by running the following command inside the root directory of your app.

```
composer install
```

**Step 2: Add Your Database Credentials** - Next, you will need to add your database credentials to your environment config. In the root folder you will see a file called `.env.example`, you will want to rename this file to: `.env`. After renaming the file, open it up in a text editor and you should see something that looks similar to the following:

```
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306

APP_URL=
DB_DATABASE=
DB_USERNAME=
DB_PASSWORD=
...
```

> Hint: Files with a `.` before their name are called hidden files so if you do not see the `.env.example` file you may have to set hidden files to visible. [Learn How To Show Hidden Files Here](https://www.howtogeek.com/194671/how-to-hide-files-and-folders-on-every-operating-system/).

The lines that you will want to pay attention to will be the `DB_HOST`, `APP_URL`, `DB_DATABASE`, `DB_USERNAME`, and `DB_PASSWORD`. You will need to enter in the URL of your application as well as your database host, name, username, and password. An example might look like this:

```
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306

APP_URL=http://website.com
DB_DATABASE=database_name
DB_USERNAME=database_user
DB_PASSWORD=database_pass
```

**Step 3: Run Your Database Migrations & Seeds** - Next, we need to run our database migrations which will add all our database tables for our application. Inside of the command line in the root of our application we will want to run the following command:

```
php artisan migrate
```

And you should see an output on your screen that looks similar to this:

<img src="https://devdojo.com/uploads/products/install-migrate-1491408435.png" alt="database migration" />

Next, we will need to seed our database with some data. Run the following command in the root of your application:

```
php artisan db:seed
```

And you should see an output that looks similar to:

<img src="https://devdojo.com/uploads/products/install-seed-1491408435.png" alt="database seed" />

Lastly, you will need to make sure you storage symlink is created by running the following command:

```
php artisan storage:link
```

That's it! The script is now installed and you will see your Ninja Media Script website in front of you ðŸŽ‰

## Default Login

After successfully installing the script you may want to login using the **default admin account** to add/edit/delete posts, pages, menu items, etc. to your site.

As an admin you can login to the site in 2 locations:

#### 1. Login Through the Front-end

You may login through the typical front-end of your site like every other user by visiting `site.com/login`

And you'll see the default login screen in front of you. 

<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/devdojo.com/products/ninja-media-script/login-front-end.jpeg" alt="front-end login screen" />

You can now login using the following **Admin Login** credentials:

```
email: admin@admin.com
password: password
```

After logging in, hover over the user menu in the top right and you will see a button called `Admin`.

<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/devdojo.com/products/ninja-media-script/login-admin-btn.jpeg" alt="User Menu Hover" />

Click on Admin link and you will now be sent to your admin dashboard:

#### 2. Login From the Back-end

Since you are an admin user you will also be able to visit: `site.com/admin/login` and you should see the new admin login screen in front of you.

<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/devdojo.com/products/ninja-media-script/admin-login.jpeg" alt="Admin Login" />

Simply enter the default **Admin Login** credentials:
